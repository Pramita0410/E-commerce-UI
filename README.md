Features: 
* Created a two-page website using CSS Grid layout/Flexbox and SASS/SCSS Features.
* Implemented a CSS Grid and a flexbox in the pages .
* Implemented all the below SASS Features:
1. Variables: Symbols that store values for reuse throughout SCSS files to maintain consistency and ease of updates.
2. Custom Properties: CSS variables, written as --name, that can be defined globally and used to apply styles dynamically.
3. Nesting: Writing SCSS selectors within other selectors to mimic HTML structure and simplify code maintenance.
4. Interpolation: The inclusion of variables or expressions within strings in SCSS, indicated by #{} syntax.
5. Placeholder Selectors: Template selectors in SCSS (starting with %) that hold style definitions for extension but do not output CSS until extended.
6. Mixins: Reusable groups of CSS declarations in SCSS that can be included in multiple classes and support arguments.
7. Functions: Reusable blocks of SCSS code that can take arguments and return a single value, often used for calculations.
8. Import: Directive in SCSS that combines multiple files into one outputted CSS file, streamlining file management.
9. Extend: Feature in SCSS that allows one selector to inherit the styles of another, reducing duplicated CSS.
